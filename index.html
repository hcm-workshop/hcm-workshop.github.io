        to support the application of AI/ML in scientific applications. The workshop will be organized as a series 
        of plenary talks based on peer-reviewed paper submissions accompanied by keynotes from distinguished 
        researchers in the area and a panel discussion. We encourage participation and submissions from universities, 
        industry, and DOE National Laboratories.</h5>
      
      <h5 class="w3-text-grey">Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) is a game-changing technology that 
        has shown tremendous advantages and improvements in algorithms, implementation, and applications. 
        We have seen many successful stories of applying AI/ML to scientific applications, such as predicting 
        extreme weather events, identifying exoplanets in trillions of sky pixels, and accelerating numerical solvers 
        in fluid simulation. However, there are a number of problems remaining to be studied to enhance the usability 
        of AI/ML to scientific applications. For example, how to systematically and automatically apply AI/ML to 
        scientific applications? How to incorporate domain knowledge (e.g., conservation laws, invariants, 
        causality and symmetries) into AI/ML models? How to make the models interpretable and robust for HPC? 
        How to make AI/ML more approachable to the HPC community? Addressing the above problems will bridge 
        the gap between AI/ML and scientific applications and enable wider employment of AI/ML in HPC.</h5>

<h2>Call for paper</h2>
<p>The memory systems are becoming heterogeneous and composable. Increasing memory heterogeneity and composability is beneficial to increase memory capacity and improve memory utilization in a cost- effective way, and reduce total cost of ownership. The heterogenous and composable memory (HCM) provides a feasible solution to support terabyte- or petabye-scale big memory systems, meeting the performance and efficiency requirements of emerging big-data applications.</p>
<p>However, building and using heterogeneous and composable memories (HCM) is challenging. We must answer a series of questions, such as how to interconnect memory components based on different memory technologies (e.g., using compute express link or CXL), how to organize those memory components in HCM for high performance, how to evolve (or even revolutionize) existing system software that traditionally handles homogeneous memory systems with small capacity, and how to build memory abstract and program constructs for HCM management. In general, HCM brings many unique opportunities and challenges, and we lack knowledge on how to build and use HCM.</p>
<p>The workshop on HCM aims to deepen our knowledge on HCM and bring together researchers in academia and industry to share early discoveries, successful examples, and opinions on opportunities and challenges regarding HCM.</p>
