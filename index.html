<h4 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the First Workshop for Heterogeneous and Composable Memory (<strong>HCM 2023</strong>)!</h4>

      <h5 class="w3-text-black"> The memory systems are becoming heterogeneous and composable. 
        Increasing memory heterogeneity and composability is beneficial to increase memory capacity 
        and improve memory utilization in a cost-effective way, and reduce total cost of ownership. 
        The heterogenous and composable memory (HCM) provides a feasible solution to support terabyte- 
        or petabye-scale big memory systems, meeting the performance and efficiency requirements of 
        emerging big-data applications.</h5>
      
      <h5 class="w3-text-black">However, building and using heterogeneous and composable memories (HCM) 
        is challenging. We must answer a series of questions, such as how to interconnect memory 
        components based on different memory technologies (e.g., using compute express link or CXL), 
        how to organize those memory components in HCM for high performance, how to evolve (or even 
        revolutionize) existing system software that traditionally handles homogeneous memory systems 
        with small capacity, and how to build memory abstract and program constructs for HCM management. 
        In general, HCM brings many unique opportunities and challenges, and we lack knowledge on how to 
        build and use HCM.</h5>
      
      <h5 class="w3-text-black"> The workshop on HCM aims to deepen our knowledge on HCM and bring together 
        researchers in academia and industry to share early discoveries, successful examples, and opinions 
        on opportunities and challenges regarding HCM.</h5>

          <p> CXL is a dynamic multi-protocol interconnect technology designed to support accelerators and memory devices. CXL provides a rich set of protocols that include I/O semantics similar to PCIe (i.e., CXL.io), caching protocol semantics (i.e., CXL.cache), 
            and memory access semantics (i.e., CXL.mem) over PCIe PHY. CXL 2.0 specification enabled additional usage models beyond CXL 1.1, while being fully backwards compatible with CXL 1.1 (and CXL 1.0). CXL 2.0 enables dynamic resource allocation including memory and accelerator dis-aggregation across multiple domains. It enables switching, managed hot-plug, security enhancements, persistence memory support, memory error reporting, and telemetry. CXL 3.0 adds new fabric capabilities to build large scale-out systems while doubling the bandwidth with full backwards compatibility to CXL 1.0 and CXL 2.0. 
            The availability of commercial IP blocks, Verification IPs, and industry standard internal interfaces enables CXL to be widely deployed across the industry. These along with a well-defined compliance program will ensure smooth interoperability across CXL devices in the industry. </p>

        <p class="w3-text-black"> <b>Abstract:</b> As memory systems are becoming increasingly heterogeneous with different latencies, bandwidths, and device characteristics, we are met with the question: where to place data and when to move data? 
          In this talk, I will discuss the problems with using traditional caching for data tiering, and I will show how this technique is inappropriate for heterogeneous memory systems. Further, I will discuss some recent  and ongoing work from the UC Davis 
          Computer Architecture Research Group (DArchR) that uses software hints to enable both transparent and application-specific data movement showing large benefits over traditional hardware caching.

        <li style="color: #0c4466;"> <b>  Invited Talk: Hasan Al Maruf, University of Michigan - TPP: Transparent Page Placement for CXL-Enabled Tiered Memory  </b></li>
        <p class="w3-text-black"> <b>Abstract:</b> ACXL-based memory expansion decouples CPU and memory within a single server and enables flexible server design with different generations and types of memory technologies. 
          It can balance the fleet-wide resource utilization and address the memory bandwidth and capacity scaling challenges in hyperscale datacenters. Without efficient memory management, however, such systems can significantly degrade application-level performance. 
          We propose a novel OS-level application-transparent page placement mechanism (TPP) for efficient CXL-memory management. TPP employs lightweight mechanisms to identify and place hot and cold pages to appropriate memory tiers. It enables page allocation to work independently from page reclamation logic which is tightly-coupled in today's Linux kernel. 
          At the same time, TPP can promptly promote performance-critical hot pages trapped in the slow memory tiers to the fast tier node. Both promotion and demotion mechanisms work transparently without prior knowledge of an application's memory access behavior. TPP improves Linux's performance by up to 18% and outperforms state-of-the-art solutions for tiered memory by 10â€“17%. 
          TPP has been actively being used in Meta datacenter for over a year and parts of it have been merged to the Linux kernel since v5.18.

        <p class="w3-text-black"> <b>Abstract: </b> Cloud providers seek to deploy CXL-based memory pools to reduce fragmentation as well as the footprint of their embedded carbon. However, the design space of CXL-based memory systems is large. Key questions center around the size, reach, topology, and cost of the memory pool. 
          Pooling also requires navigating complex design constraints around performance, virtualization, and management. This talk discusses why cloud providers are working to deploy CXL memory pools, key design constraints, and observations in designing towards practical deployment.

        <li style="color: #0c4466;"><b>  Invited Talk: Christina Giannnoula, University of Toronto - Efficient Data Movement in Fully Disaggregated Memory Systems </b></li>
        <p class="w3-text-black"> <b>Abstract:</b> Resource disaggregation offers a cost effective solution to resource scaling, utilization, and failure-handling in data centers by physically separating hardware devices in a server. Servers are architected as pools of processor, memory, 
          and storage devices, organized as independent failure-isolated components interconnected by a high-bandwidth network. A critical challenge, however, is the high performance penalty of accessing data from a remote memory module over the network. Addressing this challenge is difficult as 
          disaggregated systems have high runtime variability in network latencies/bandwidth, and page migration can significantly delay critical path cache line accesses in other pages. In this talk, we present a characterization analysis on different data movement strategies in fully disaggregated 
          systems and discuss their performance overheads in a variety of workloads. Then, we describe our new adaptive and software-transparent mechanism that can significantly alleviate data movement overheads in fully disaggregated memory systems. We demonstrate how our proposed hardware mechanism achieves 
          high system performance and robustness in data movement across a wide variety of emerging workloads at different network and architecture configurations. We conclude by providing future research directions on designing intelligent architectures and adaptive approaches for modern computing systems.
