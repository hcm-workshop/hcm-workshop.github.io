<h2>Call for paper</h2>
<p>The memory systems are becoming heterogeneous and composable. Increasing memory heterogeneity and composability is beneficial to increase memory capacity and improve memory utilization in a cost- effective way, and reduce total cost of ownership. The heterogenous and composable memory (HCM) provides a feasible solution to support terabyte- or petabye-scale big memory systems, meeting the performance and efficiency requirements of emerging big-data applications.</p>
<p>However, building and using heterogeneous and composable memories (HCM) is challenging. We must answer a series of questions, such as how to interconnect memory components based on different memory technologies (e.g., using compute express link or CXL), how to organize those memory components in HCM for high performance, how to evolve (or even revolutionize) existing system software that traditionally handles homogeneous memory systems with small capacity, and how to build memory abstract and program constructs for HCM management. In general, HCM brings many unique opportunities and challenges, and we lack knowledge on how to build and use HCM.</p>
<p>The workshop on HCM aims to deepen our knowledge on HCM and bring together researchers in academia and industry to share early discoveries, successful examples, and opinions on opportunities and challenges regarding HCM.</p>

<p><strong>Format</strong></p>
<p>All submissions should be made electronically through the Easychair website. Submissions must be double blind, i.e., authors should remove their names, institutions or hints found in references to earlier work. When discussing past work, they need to refer to themselves in the third person, as if they were discussing another researcher&rsquo;s work. Furthermore, authors must identify any conflict of interest with the PC chair or PC members. Each paper is a 2-page abstract, using IEEE conference format. The page limit includes figures, tables, and your appendices, but does not include references, for which there is no page limit. Papers should be submitted in PDF format. We kindly refer authors to the necessary templates.</p>
